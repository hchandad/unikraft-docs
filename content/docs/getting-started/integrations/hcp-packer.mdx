<Info>
To get started immediately, [check out the repository README](https://github.com/unikraft/packer-plugin-unikraft/blob/main/README.md) or see the [installation instructions below](#Installation).
</Info>

## Overview

The plugin interfaces with the native [Go API
offered](https://pkg.go.dev/kraftkit.sh) by [KraftKit](https://kraftkit.sh),
Unikraft's command-line companion tool, to handle everything related to linking
your application with Unikraft.  Thanks to this interface, the plugin itself is
kept light and modular.


The following minimalistic configuration allows you to build unikernel
applications.  For example building [`app-helloworld` unikernel
application](https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld.git):

```hcl
source "unikraft-builder" "example" {
  // Target architecture of the resulting VM binary
  architecture = "x86_64"

  // Target platform of the resulting VM binary
  platform = "kvm"

  // Path of the resulting binaries
  build_path = "/tmp/my-packer-unikernel/.unikraft/apps/helloworld"

  // Path where to pull the sources and build the binaries
  workdir = "/tmp/my-packer-unikernel"

  // Application to pull and build
  pull_source = "helloworld"

  // Extra sources to use for the application 
  sources = [
    "https://github.com/unikraft/app-helloworld.git",
  ]
}
```


## Installation

      version = ">= 0.1.0"
      source  = "github.com/unikraft/packer-plugin-unikraft"
    }
  }
}
```
