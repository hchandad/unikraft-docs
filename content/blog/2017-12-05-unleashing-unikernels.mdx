The team at [NEC Laboratories Europe](http://sysml.neclab.eu/) spent quite a bit of time over the
last few years developing unikernels (specialized virtual machine
images targeting specific applications). This technology is fascinating
to us because of its fantastic performance benefits: tiny memory
footprints (hundreds of KBs or a few MBs), boot times comparable to
those of processes or throughput in the range of 10-40 Gb/s, among
many other attributes. Specific metrics can be found in these
articles:

* [My VM is Lighter (and Safer) than your Container](http://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3132763&type=pdf)
* [Unikernels Everywhere: The Case for Elastic CDNs](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3050757)
* [ClickOS and the Art of Network Function Virtualization](https://www.usenix.org/node/179772)

The potential of unikernels is great (as you can see from the work
above), but there hasn'st been a massive adoption of unikernels. Why?
Development time. For example, developing [Minipython](https://github.com/sysml/minipython), a MicroPython
unikernel, took the better part of three months to put together and
test. [ClickOS](https://github.com/sysml/clickos), a unikernel for NFV, was the result of a couple of
years of work.

What's particularly bad about this development model, besides the
considerable time spent, is each unikernel is basically a throwaway:
every time we want to create a new unikernel targeting a different
application, developers have to start from scratch. Essentially, there
is a lack of shared research and development when it comes to building
unikernels.

We (at NEC) wanted to change this, so we started to re-use the work
and created a separate repo consisting of a toolstack hat would
contain functionality useful to multiple unikernels — mostly
platform-independent versions of newlib and lwip (a C library and
network stack intended for embedded systems).  This got us thinking
that we should take our work to a much bigger level. We asked the
question: Wouldn't it be great to be able to very quickly choose,
perhaps from a menu, the bits of functionality that we want for a
unikernel, and to have a system automatically build all of these
pieces together into a working image? It would also be great if we
could choose multiple platforms (e.g., Xen, KVM, bare metal) without
having to do additional work for each of them.

The result of that thought process is Unikraft. Unikraft decomposes
operating systems into elementary pieces called libraries (e.g.,
schedulers, memory allocators, drivers, filesystems, network stacks,
etc.) that users can then pick and choose from, using a menu to
quickly build images tailored to the needs of specific
applications. In greater detail, Unikraft consists of two basic
components (see Figure 1):

* **Library pools** contain libraries that the user of Unikraft can
    select from to create the unikernel. From the bottom up, library
    pools are organized into (1) the architecture library tool,
    containing libraries specific to a computer architecture (e.g.,
    x86_64, ARM32 or MIPS); (2) the platform tool, where target
    platforms can be Xen, KVM, bare metal (i.e. no virtualization),
    user-space Linux and potentially even containers; and (3) the main
    library pool, containing a rich set of functionality to build the
    unikernel. This last library includes drivers (both virtual such
    as netback/netfront and physical such as ixgbe), filesystems,
    memory allocators, schedulers, network stacks, standard libs
    (e.g. libc, openssl, etc.), and runtimes (e.g. a Python
    interpreter and debugging and profiling tools). These pools of
    libraries constitute a codebase for creating unikernels. As shown,
    a library can be relatively large (e.g libc) or quite small (a
    scheduler), which allows for customization for the unikernel.

* **The Unikraft build tool** is in charge of compiling the
    application and the selected libraries together to create a binary
    for a specific platform and architecture (e.g., Xen on
    x86_64). The tool is currently inspired by Linuxâ€™s KCONFIG
    system and consists of a set of Makefiles. It allows users to
    select libraries, to configure them, and to warn them when library
    dependencies are not met. In addition, the tool can also
    simultaneously generate binaries for multiple platforms.

## Getting Involved

We are very excited about the recent open source release of Unikraft
as a Xen Project Foundation incubator project. The Xen Project is a
part of the Linux Foundation umbrella. We welcome developers willing
to help improve Unikraft. Whether you're interested in particular
applications, programming languages, platforms, architectures or OS
primitive. We are more than happy to build and receive contributions
from the community. To get you started, here are a number of available
resources:

* **Developer's guide**: available in the docs directory of the Unikraft sources or [here](http://docs.unikraft.org/)
* **Website**: The main Unikraft website: http://unikraft.org
* **Mailing list**: we share the mailing list with MiniOS, please subscribe [here](https://lists.xenproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/minios-devel)

Please don't be shy about getting in touch with us, we would be more
than happy to answer any questions you may have. You can reach the
core Unikraft development team at sysml@listserv.neclab.eu .
